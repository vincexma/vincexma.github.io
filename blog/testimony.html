I grew up a pretty carefree kid, and for the most part I always just did what made me most happy.
To me, our Friday night Bible studies were a great place to hang out with friends. I understood nothing about the Bible.
<br>
Moving to China made me appreciate the friends I had left all the more.
I lived in Beijing and fit in quite well. But I was still longing for my home in the USA.
<br>
Coming back, I expected everything to resume as it once was.
Instead, the necessity to shift my focus became more apparent.
I found an easy answer in school. Academics and sports became an idol to work for.
<br>
Graduating from high school, I questioned what I wanted to do.
And realized that all of it was worthless.
<br>
God is the only one who is worth anything.
